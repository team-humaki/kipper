// Every route the console serves declares how it is authorized. The table is
// the inventory step 2 of the RBAC plan calls for, and the tests below hold it
// to the router and to the recorded matrix.
//
// It exists because a route added without a gate does not look like anything.
// It answers 200, the reviewer sees a handler, and nothing in the suite objects.
// With this table an unclassified route fails the build, and a route whose
// declaration disagrees with the answers the matrix recorded fails too.
//
// What no test here can check is whether the capability a route names describes
// what the handler actually hands over. Several capabilities are held by exactly
// the same built-in roles, so naming the wrong one of those reproduces every
// column and passes. Four review rounds each found entries of that shape, in
// routes nobody had questioned: a file listing under "read apps and services", a
// diagnosis route that ships pod logs to an external provider, a token that is
// really a deploy. They were found by reading handlers, and the next one will be
// too.
//
// So this table is reviewed rather than proven, and the release that makes it
// the gate has to re-read it rather than trust that the build is green. It will
// have a better tool than a re-read: once a capability is what admits a caller,
// a probe holding exactly one capability separates the ten that share built-in
// membership, the way a column with a lower cluster role would separate the
// global ranks below. Both are fixtures that cannot exist while role ranks are
// still the gate.

	// Find that family by its gate rather than by any list, including this one:
	// it is the callers of canAccessNamespace, whether directly or through

	// the resource log, the usage summary, both alerts routes, the dashboard and

	// following the helper's callers, which is what the next reader should do.

	// GET /api/v1/projects is in the family and outside that gate. It filters on
